# Medical Care Lab

## Project Description
This project aims to create a JAVA program that implements the functionalities of a "laboratory test appointment reservation" application. The program is designed to develop a management tool for scheduling laboratory test appointments. It offers users a service to schedule blood tests and blood work analysis. Tests are grouped by type (e.g., Blood Glucose, PCR, Cholesterol, Red Blood Cells, etc.). Reservations and their characteristics are stored in a "Labotest" database.

## Core Features
The application offers two main services to users:
1. Confirmation of reservations
2. Cancellation of reservations

After each confirmation, the characteristics of the reserved test must be stored in a class called "Labotest" and added to a "reservation" database. In case of cancellation, the test characteristics must be removed from both the "reservation" database and the "Labotest" class. At the end of the program, reserved tests are displayed along with the total amount to pay (price including 11% tax). An invoice is generated and saved in a file containing the user's name, reserved tests, and results, sorted by test prices in ascending order.

## User Information
User information is stored in a "Patient" database containing:
- First name
- Last name
- Password (hashed*)
- Email address
- Phone number

*Note: A hash function calculates a unique signature from the provided data; in this case, the provided data represents passwords. Some hash functions include MD5, SHA1, SHA2, etc.

## Program Flow

### Initial Authentication
The program starts by asking users if they have an account:
- New users must create an account (step 1 below) and store data in the "Patient" database
- Existing users must authenticate using their email and password before proceeding to step 2
User data must be stored in the "Patient" class in both cases.

### Step 1: User Registration
Users must provide:
- First and last name
- Password (minimum 8 characters, must contain numbers, letters, and special characters)
- Email address (format must be validated)
- Phone number (format must be validated)
Note: Each user's ID must be unique and automatically generated by the program.

### Step 2: User Types and Functions

#### Administrator Access
Administrators can:
1. Add information to the "Labotest" database through console input (must check for existing tests to avoid data redundancy)
2. Delete tests from the "Labotest" database
3. Modify existing test data in the "Labotest" database

#### Patient Access
Patients can:
1. Reserve an appointment for a laboratory test by entering the desired reservation date
   - Program displays available tests for that date
   - After test selection, information is stored in the "Labotest" class within the "Patient" class and the "reservation" database
2. Cancel a reservation
   - Program displays tests reserved by the patient for selection and cancellation

### Step 3: Payment Processing
- Calculate total amount to pay
- Store result and user information
